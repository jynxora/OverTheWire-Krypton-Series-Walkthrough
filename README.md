# OverTheWire Krypton — Complete Cryptography Challenge Walkthrough  
**#700DaysOfSkill journey by Jinay Shah**

---

### Overview
This repository documents my full journey through the **OverTheWire Krypton** wargame — a series of seven challenges focused on **classical cryptography**, encryption logic, and cipher analysis.  

Unlike earlier series (Bandit, Leviathan, Natas), this one was approached like a **cryptanalysis report** — methodical, tool-agnostic, and focused on reasoning, not just results.  

Each level explores a core cryptographic idea and demonstrates both **manual reasoning** and **script-based validation**.

### Contents
- **`OverTheWire_Krypton_Series.pdf`** → Complete documentation (Levels 0–6)  
- **Scripts/** → Python utilities for substitution decoding, Caesar shifts, and frequency analysis  
- **Notes/** → Supplementary research references, logic summaries, and explanation notes  
- **Resources.md** → External references used during the analysis  

---

### Key Highlights
- Manual cipher-solving (Caesar, ROT13, Vigenère, frequency-based analysis)  
- Integration of scripting and logic-based decryption  
- Structured forensic-style documentation  
- Focus on explaining *why* each cipher works, not just *how* to break it  

---

### Learning Takeaways
- Foundational understanding of symmetric and substitution ciphers  
- Deepened analytical reasoning before automation  
- Improved documentation structure — written like a professional forensic report  
- Bridging traditional cryptography with post-quantum perspectives
